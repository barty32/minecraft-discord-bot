# MCserver interface
Minecraft server interface using a Discord bot as a frontend. This project allows you to keep only a light program running (Discord bot) for example on a Raspberry PI, which then remotely starts a more powerful computer which hosts the server itself. This configuration allows for great power savings, since the computer with much higher consumption only runs when requested.
